              <p>
                Founded by coffee enthusiast Maria Contoso, our journey began 
                with a simple mission: to bring the world's finest coffee 
                experiences to our local community. What started as a small 
                family business has grown into a beloved local institution.
              </p>
              <p>
                We source our beans directly from farmers around the world, 
                ensuring fair trade practices and supporting sustainable 
                coffee growing communities.
